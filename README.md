## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to use the CSS custom properties and how to use the flexbox. I've also learned how to use the media queries to make the website responsive.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>I love HTMl</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  content: "CSS is awesome!";
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('JS is fun!')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on the CSS custom properties and the flexbox. I also want to learn how to use the grid layout and the CSS animations.
